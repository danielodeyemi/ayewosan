  - **REMOVE after use!**

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### For First-Time Deployment:

```bash
# 1. Prepare locally (Windows)
prepare-deployment.bat

# 2. Upload files via FTP:
#    - Laravel app files → /home/username/laravel_app/
#    - public/ contents → /home/username/public_html/

# 3. Edit public/index.php
#    Change "../vendor" to "../laravel_app/vendor"
#    Change "../bootstrap" to "../laravel_app/bootstrap"

# 4. Set permissions (via SSH or cPanel):
#    .env = 600
#    storage/ = 775 (recursive)
#    bootstrap/cache/ = 775 (recursive)

# 5. Run setup (if SSH available):
cd /home/username/laravel_app
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan storage:link
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache

# 6. Test your site!
```

### Without SSH Access:

1. Follow steps 1-4 above
2. Add routes from `deployment-routes-temp.php` to `routes/web.php`
3. Visit the deployment URLs in your browser
4. **Immediately remove those routes!**
